# Idempotent bulk catalog ingestion with Gel

## Background

`/home/user/catalog` is a Gel project (Gel server 6.11) already linked to a running local instance named `geltask`. Its schema currently defines a single object type, `Supplier` (properties `code` and `name`, `code` is exclusive), and it has exactly one applied migration.

A partner ERP publishes product-catalog snapshots as batches of JSON-ish records. Snapshots get replayed all the time (retries, overlapping cron runs), so ingestion has to be genuinely *idempotent*: replaying a snapshot that carries nothing new must leave the database untouched. Batches also arrive dirty: malformed rows, rows pointing at suppliers that do not exist, and the same product repeated twice inside one batch.

## Requirements

### 1. Schema

Add a `Product` object type to module `default` and bring it into the database through the project's migration history, so that the project stays in sync with the instance. `Product` has these **required** members:

| member | type | notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `source_system` | `str` | |
| `external_id` | `str` | |
| `name` | `str` | the database must refuse values longer than 200 characters |
| `price_cents` | `int64` | the database must refuse negative values |
| `revision` | `int64` | |
| `updated_at` | `datetime` | |
| `supplier` | single link to `Supplier` | |

The pair `(source_system, external_id)` is the **natural key** of a product, and the database itself must refuse a second `Product` carrying a natural key that already exists.

`Product` must not require any member beyond the seven listed above, and it must stay insertable by a plain EdgeQL `insert` that supplies exactly those seven members.

Do not change the existing `Supplier` type and do not rewrite the existing migration.

### 2. Ingestion API

Create a Python package `catalog_ingest` inside the project that exposes:

```python
# /home/user/catalog/catalog_ingest/pipeline.py
async def ingest_batch(client, records):
    ...
```

`client` is an already-connected asynchronous Gel client object handed in by the caller, and `records` is a `list`. `ingest_batch` must work exclusively through that object; it must not open a connection of its own.

### 3. Per-record acceptance rules

Records are processed in list order. A record is **well-formed** when it is a `dict` that carries:

- `source_system`: non-empty `str`
- `external_id`: non-empty `str`
- `name`: non-empty `str`
- `price_cents`: `int` that is `>= 0` (a `bool` does not qualify as an `int` here)
- `supplier_code`: non-empty `str`

Any additional key in the record is ignored. Every record is classified by the **first** matching rule:

1. not well-formed — rejected, reason `invalid_record`
2. the database holds no `Supplier` whose `code` equals `supplier_code` — rejected, reason `unknown_supplier`
3. its natural key equals the natural key of an **earlier, non-rejected** record of the same call — rejected, reason `duplicate_key` (the earlier record is the one that gets applied)

Anything else is **accepted**. These rules are exhaustive: an accepted record must be handed to the database even when the database is going to refuse it.

### 4. Effect of accepted records

- Natural key absent from the database: a new `Product` is created with `revision` 1 and `updated_at` set to the ingestion timestamp.
- Natural key present, and `name`, `price_cents` and the linked supplier all already equal the incoming values: nothing at all changes for that product — its stored `revision` and `updated_at` keep their previous values.
- Natural key present, and at least one of those three differs: the three are overwritten, `revision` becomes the stored `revision` plus 1, and `updated_at` becomes the ingestion timestamp.

### 5. Return value

`ingest_batch` returns a `dict` with exactly the keys `inserted`, `updated`, `unchanged`, `rejected` and `rejects`:

- `inserted`, `updated`, `unchanged`: `int`, the number of accepted records that produced each of the three outcomes of section 4, in that order.
- `rejected`: `int`, equal to `len(rejects)`.
- `rejects`: `list` of `dict`s, each with exactly the keys `index` (`int`, 0-based position of the record inside `records`) and `reason` (one of the three strings of section 3), ordered by ascending `index`.
- `inserted + updated + unchanged + rejected` always equals `len(records)`.

### 6. Atomicity

Every database write of one call belongs to a single all-or-nothing unit. When the database refuses the batch, the error must propagate out of `ingest_batch`, and not one product may have been created or modified by that call.

### 7. Round-trip budget

One call to `ingest_batch` may execute **at most 3** EdgeQL statements through the supplied client, no matter how large the batch is. A statement execution is counted as a call to `query`, `query_single`, `query_required_single`, `query_json`, `query_single_json`, `query_required_single_json` or `execute`, both on the client itself and on any transaction object obtained from it.

## Implementation Hints

- Project path: `/home/user/catalog`
- Python import path: `catalog_ingest.pipeline`, coroutine function `ingest_batch`, imported with `/home/user/catalog` as the working directory.
- The Gel CLI (`gel`), the Gel 6.11 server and the `gel` Python client 3.1.0 are installed locally. No external service is available or needed — everything runs against the local instance.
- The instance is **not** started automatically when the container boots. Run `gel-start-instance` (idempotent, already on `PATH`) to bring it up; the database server runs under the unprivileged account `gelsrv`, while everything else runs as `root`.
- Schema changes have to travel through migration files under `dbschema/migrations`; the checked-out project and the instance must end up in sync.
