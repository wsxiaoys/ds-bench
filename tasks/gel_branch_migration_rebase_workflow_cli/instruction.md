# Reconcile Two Parallel Feature Branches in a Gel Database Project

## Background
The `branchlab` project is an editorial catalog backed by a local **Gel 7.1** instance named `devinst`. The project is already linked to that instance, its active branch is `main`, `main` already has one applied migration and it already holds production-like data (four `Author` objects and twelve `Article` objects).

Two teams now need to extend the catalog at the same time, each on its own Gel database branch, and their work has to be reconciled back onto `main` afterwards without losing a single row.

Everything runs locally inside this container. There is no network access, no cloud, and no external service.

## Requirements

### The two features
Develop each feature on its **own Gel branch**, and make both branches diverge from `main` as it is *right now* (neither feature branch may be started from the other, and neither may already contain the other's schema changes when its own migration is created):

- Branch `feat_tags` introduces tagging:
  - a new object type `Tag` with a `required label: str` that is exclusive;
  - a new `multi tags: Tag` link on `Article`.
- Branch `feat_review` introduces the review workflow:
  - a new `required review_state: str` property on `Article`.

Each feature branch must contribute **exactly one** new migration.

### The reconciled `main`
When you are done, `main` must satisfy all of the following:

- Its schema contains **both** features exactly as described above (`Tag`, `Article.tags`, `Article.review_state`).
- Its migration history is **linear** and contains **exactly three** migrations: the pre-existing one, plus one migration per feature (every migration has at most one parent, and the three form a single chain rooted at the pre-existing migration).
- All pre-existing data survives **in place**: the same four `Author` objects and the same twelve `Article` objects, with unchanged `id` values, unchanged `name`/`country`, unchanged `title`/`word_count`, and unchanged article-to-author links. Nothing may be deleted and re-inserted.
- Every pre-existing article is back-filled so that `review_state` is `"needs_review"` when its `word_count` is 1200 or more, and `"archived"` otherwise.
- Exactly one `Tag` object exists, with `label` `"longform"`, and it is linked through `Article.tags` to exactly those articles whose `word_count` is 1000 or more. Every other article has no tags.

### The surviving branches
- At the end, the instance must hold **exactly two** branches: `main` and `feat_review`. `feat_tags` must no longer exist, and no scratch/temporary branch may be left behind.
- `feat_review` must end up carrying the same three-migration linear history as `main`.
- The project's active branch must be `main`.
- Run from the project directory, `gel migration status` must exit with status `0` for `main` **and** for `feat_review` (i.e. the working schema files, the migration files on disk, and each branch's applied history all agree).
- `dbschema/default.gel` must describe the final combined schema, and `dbschema/migrations/` must contain exactly the three migration files of that history — no leftovers.

## Implementation Hints
- Project path: `/home/user/branchlab` (a git repository; git state is not graded).
- Gel instance name: `devinst`. If the server is not running, start it with `gel-start` (it waits until the instance accepts connections). Never destroy, wipe or re-create the instance or the `main` branch.
- Reproduction script: `/home/user/branchlab/reconcile.sh`. It must be executable, begin with a `#!` shebang line, and contain at least three comment lines documenting what it does. It must be safe to run again on the already-reconciled project: `bash /home/user/branchlab/reconcile.sh` must exit `0` within 10 minutes and must leave the end state described above completely unchanged.
- Report file: `/home/user/branchlab/reconcile-report.json`, a JSON object with exactly these five keys:
  - `main_branch` (string): the name of the reconciled trunk branch;
  - `feature_branches` (array of strings): the names of the two feature branches you created, sorted in ascending order;
  - `surviving_branches` (array of strings): the names of all branches that still exist on the instance, sorted in ascending order;
  - `final_migration_count` (integer): the number of migrations in the final history of the trunk branch;
  - `reproduction_script` (string): the absolute path of the reproduction script.
- No requirement is placed on the data stored in `feat_review`; only its schema and migration history are graded.
